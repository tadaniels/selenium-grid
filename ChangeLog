 - 
Summary of changes from 0.9.4 to 1.0 - Feb 25 2008
===================================================

 Main highlights for the 1.0 release include:

 Amazon EC2 Integration and Automation
 -------------------------------------

  Selenium Grid now comes with out-of-the-box support for EC2. There is an
  official EC2 image which bundles all the tools you need to establish a
  Selenium Grid cluster on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (including a VNC
  server). Selenium Grid 1.0 also comes with Capistrano tasks to automate
  deployment and management of the Selenium Grid on EC2 (in the examples/ec2
  directory). Check out the Selenium Grid Website for more details on the EC2
  instrumentation and how to run Selenium Grid Demo on EC2.

 New Ruby Example
 ----------------

  A new example demonstrating how to run in parallel Selenium tests written in
  Ruby (RSpec)

  See the examples/rspec directory. The current solution (spawning multiple
  processes) is basic but works great and is used daily on professional
  projects. The plan is to evolve the current solution to an actual RSpec test
  runner based on Rinda/DRb, Memcache or a flavor a MapReduce. Of course
  contributions are welcome. Make sure that you also have a look in the
  reports directory after running the tests: You will see some nice test
  reports including screenshots of the application under test. The screenshot
  formatter used in Selenium Grid Ruby example is based on Spec::UI code by
  Aslak, just tweaked a little bit to make it work with RSpec 1.1.3.

 TestNG based Demo
 -----------------

  Selenium Grid demo is now powered by TestNG (in lieu of Parallel JUnit)

  TestNG provides the best and the more scalable solution to run tests in
  parallel for Selenium tests written in Java. The demo now demonstrates best
  practices in the field. Feel free to use it as a starting point when
  instrumenting your Selenium test suite for Selenium Grid.

 RC Startup Parameters
 ---------------------

  Additional parameters can be passed to Selenium remote controls at startup

  Just set the seleniumArgs Java property when launching the remote control.
  For instance, to start a remote control in multi window and debug mode you
  would use:
  ant -DseleniumArgs="-multiWindow -debug" launch-remote-control

  Ruby dudes can use:
  rake hub:start SELENIUM_ARGS="-multiWindow -debug"

 Support for Selenium RC 0.9.3
 -----------------------------

  Selenium Grid now works with 0.9.3 Remote Controls

  Just replace the lib/selenium-server-0.9.2.jar library packaged in Selenium
  Grid distribution with a 0.9.3 snapshot of Selenium Remote Control if you
  want to try it out. Selenium Remote Control 0.9.3 branch changed the way the
  session IDs are set and is now using GUIDs.

 Better handling of massive text field values
 --------------------------------------------

  Selenium Grid was choking when testing fields with big chunks of text.
  Selenium Grid now uses HTTP POST to relay Selenese commands to the remote
  controls and everything works like a charm.

 Support for web pages including international characters
 --------------------------------------------------------

  Selenium Grid was also misbehaving for web pages with international
  characters. Not anymore! Selenium Grid now speaks whatever language you
  speak. Since Selenium Remote Control does not explicitly set the charset in
  HTTP request headers, we changed our HttpClient wrapper to assume UTF-8.

  Thanks to Vinay Tota, Maria Elisa Sanchez, Sam Chen, Miles, Shiang Luong,
  Daniel Stironek, Adrian Gan, Mattias, Sem Adou, Joel and David Burns for
  reporting bugs, suggesting interesting new features or helping me improve
  the documentation in the Selenium Grid Forums. Thank you also to Clint
  Bishop who helped convert some test to JRuby, and to Patrick Lightbody who
  is always here to help me with OpenQA infrastructure.

Summary of changes from 0.9.3 to 0.9.4
======================================

Philippe Hanrigou <http://ph7spot.com>:

  * Sample parallel test suite using Ruby/RSpec

  * Converted Demo to TestNG

  * Made Selenium Grid work with Selenium 0.9.3 RC.
    Latest RC has changed the way the session IDs are set and 
    is now using GUIDs.

  * Allow custom arguments to be passed to RCs at startup

    ant -DseleniumArgs="..." launch-remote-control
    
  * Bug Fix: Can handle commands with huge text payload.
    Use POST not GET to transfer commands to RCs to be able 
    to process type commands with a huge text

  * Bug Fix: Properly handle international characters.
    Fixed HttpClient wrapper to assume UTF-8 as Charset is 
    not explicitely set.

  * Introduced JRuby for testing


Clinton Bishop:

  * Helped converting some tests to JRuby
