                   Selenium Grid ChangeLog
                  =========================


Summary of changes from 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 (May 11 2010)
====================================================

 * Hub now instructs remote controls to shutdown a session if the hub
   is going to remove it due to being idle for too long

 * Added ability to specify timeout period when waiting for remote controls
   to become available.  Now the client can timeout gracefully and decide what
   it would like to do next

 * Handle common case of session ID not being found, either because it timed out
   or was already closed; rather than raising a NullPointerException we now raise
   a NoSuchSessionException

 * Truncate long command response bodies to 128 characters

 * Retry remote control checks up to three times before deciding that a remote
   control is unreliable or unresponsive.  This prevents aggressive unregistration
   of hosts that are busy or suffer from network issues


Summary of changes from 1.0.5 to 1.0.6 (April 8 2010)
=====================================================

 * Fixed issue with shutting down workers with Rakefile
 
 * Added PID file support for hub and worker started via Rakefile,
   making it easier to use a process monitor such as monit

 * Fixed some concurrent modification issues that may have resulted
   in NullPointerExceptions

Summary of changes from 1.0.4 to 1.0.5 (March 16 2010)
======================================================

 * Allow RC's to re-register with the Hub even if already registered

 * Remove registered RCs when detected as unreliable at reservation time

 * Periodically poll RCs and remove the ones detected as unreliable

 * RC -> Hub automatic reconnection 

 * Fixed Rake automation on Windows 
   http://github.com/ph7/selenium-grid/issues/closed#issue/2
 
 * Upgraded RC so that Firefox automation works on Snow Leopard

 * Fixed demo and example test cases (Changes in Google images) 

 * Upgraded Selenium Remote Control to 1.0.3

 * Fix "Errors for ec2-run-instances cause erratic grid instantiation 
   in EC2 example" (Contributed by Christian Eager)

Summary of changes from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4 (Jul 7 2009)
===================================================

 * Upgraded Selenium RC to 1.0.1
 * Better error message when there is no registered 
   remote control for a requested environment.
 * Direct link to FAQ in Hub console
 * Change Examples to target Google Video: Flickr 
   randomly drops some requests causing
   test timeouts

Summary of changes from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3
======================================

 * https proxy support for RC via https.proxyHost and 
   https.proxyPort JVM properties
   (http://clearspace.openqa.org/message/54188)

Summary of changes from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3 - Nov 27 2008
====================================================

 * Fixed the Ruby example to pick the custom RSpec report from the
   appropriate selenium-client installation when there are multiple
   selenium-client gems installed.

 * Moved the Selenium RC server jar to the vendor/ directory 
   (as opposed to lib/)

Summary of changes from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2 - Oct 23 2008
====================================================

    (http.proxyHost and http.proxyPort system properties)
  * Added a restful shutdown for Selenium Grid Hub .
  * Less brutal shutdown task for Hub and Remote Controls
    (POST /lifecycle-manager action=shutdown)
  * Samples now showcasing Flickr as Amazon website is changing way too often
  * Rakefile now honors hub port defined in grid_configuration.xml
    (Thank you Bob Cotton)
  * Bug Fixes
  * Improved FAQ and website

    Rakefile use the hub port defined in grid_configuration.xml

Summary of changes from 1.0 to 1.0.1 - Apr 15 2008
==================================================

 - Fixed Grid-4 (http://jira.seleniumhq.org/browse/GRID-4):
   Selenium does not properly handle accentuated for input fields

   Rake task. environments name can't contain space

   Selenium Grid does not release a Remote Control when 
   returned session Id is null

 - 
Summary of changes from 0.9.4 to 1.0 - Feb 25 2008
===================================================

 Main highlights for the 1.0 release include:

 Amazon EC2 Integration and Automation
 -------------------------------------

  Selenium Grid now comes with out-of-the-box support for EC2. There is an
  official EC2 image which bundles all the tools you need to establish a
  Selenium Grid cluster on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (including a VNC
  server). Selenium Grid 1.0 also comes with Capistrano tasks to automate
  deployment and management of the Selenium Grid on EC2 (in the examples/ec2
  directory). Check out the Selenium Grid Website for more details on the EC2
  instrumentation and how to run Selenium Grid Demo on EC2.

 New Ruby Example
 ----------------

  A new example demonstrating how to run in parallel Selenium tests written in
  Ruby (RSpec)

  See the examples/rspec directory. The current solution (spawning multiple
  processes) is basic but works great and is used daily on professional
  projects. The plan is to evolve the current solution to an actual RSpec test
  runner based on Rinda/DRb, Memcache or a flavor a MapReduce. Of course
  contributions are welcome. Make sure that you also have a look in the
  reports directory after running the tests: You will see some nice test
  reports including screenshots of the application under test. The screenshot
  formatter used in Selenium Grid Ruby example is based on Spec::UI code by
  Aslak, just tweaked a little bit to make it work with RSpec 1.1.3.

 TestNG based Demo
 -----------------

  Selenium Grid demo is now powered by TestNG (in lieu of Parallel JUnit)

  TestNG provides the best and the more scalable solution to run tests in
  parallel for Selenium tests written in Java. The demo now demonstrates best
  practices in the field. Feel free to use it as a starting point when
  instrumenting your Selenium test suite for Selenium Grid.

 RC Startup Parameters
 ---------------------

  Additional parameters can be passed to Selenium remote controls at startup

  Just set the seleniumArgs Java property when launching the remote control.
  For instance, to start a remote control in multi window and debug mode you
  would use:
  ant -DseleniumArgs="-multiWindow -debug" launch-remote-control

  Ruby dudes can use:
  rake hub:start SELENIUM_ARGS="-multiWindow -debug"

 Support for Selenium RC 0.9.3
 -----------------------------

  Selenium Grid now works with 0.9.3 Remote Controls

  Just replace the lib/selenium-server-0.9.2.jar library packaged in Selenium
  Grid distribution with a 0.9.3 snapshot of Selenium Remote Control if you
  want to try it out. Selenium Remote Control 0.9.3 branch changed the way the
  session IDs are set and is now using GUIDs.

 Better handling of massive text field values
 --------------------------------------------

  Selenium Grid was choking when testing fields with big chunks of text.
  Selenium Grid now uses HTTP POST to relay Selenese commands to the remote
  controls and everything works like a charm.

 Support for web pages including international characters
 --------------------------------------------------------

  Selenium Grid was also misbehaving for web pages with international
  characters. Not anymore! Selenium Grid now speaks whatever language you
  speak. Since Selenium Remote Control does not explicitly set the charset in
  HTTP request headers, we changed our HttpClient wrapper to assume UTF-8.

  Thanks to Vinay Tota, Maria Elisa Sanchez, Sam Chen, Miles, Shiang Luong,
  Daniel Stironek, Adrian Gan, Mattias, Sem Adou, Joel and David Burns for
  reporting bugs, suggesting interesting new features or helping me improve
  the documentation in the Selenium Grid Forums. Thank you also to Clint
  Bishop who helped convert some test to JRuby, and to Patrick Lightbody who
  is always here to help me with OpenQA infrastructure.

Summary of changes from 0.9.3 to 0.9.4
======================================

Philippe Hanrigou <http://ph7spot.com>:

  * Sample parallel test suite using Ruby/RSpec

  * Converted Demo to TestNG

  * Made Selenium Grid work with Selenium 0.9.3 RC.
    Latest RC has changed the way the session IDs are set and 
    is now using GUIDs.

  * Allow custom arguments to be passed to RCs at startup

    ant -DseleniumArgs="..." launch-remote-control
    
  * Bug Fix: Can handle commands with huge text payload.
    Use POST not GET to transfer commands to RCs to be able 
    to process type commands with a huge text

  * Bug Fix: Properly handle international characters.
    Fixed HttpClient wrapper to assume UTF-8 as Charset is 
    not explicitely set.

  * Introduced JRuby for testing


Clinton Bishop:

  * Helped converting some tests to JRuby
